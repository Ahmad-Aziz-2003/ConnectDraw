# ConnectDraw

ConnectDraw is a draw.io type replica built with React.js and Vite. It allows users to create diagrams with four basic shapes: diamond, rectangle, circle, and parallelogram. This project utilizes the `react-dnd` library for drag-and-drop functionality.

## Features

- **Drag and Drop**: Easily drag and drop shapes onto the canvas.
- **Shape Renaming**: Rename shapes to better organize your diagrams.
- **Shape Connections**: Connect shapes with lines.
- **Clear Canvas**: Clear the entire canvas to start fresh.
- **Save Canvas**: Save the current state of the canvas to local storage.
- **Persistent State**: The canvas state is preserved across browser refreshes.

 ## Usage
 
 - Drag and drop shapes onto the canvas.
 - Rename shapes by double-clicking on them.
 - Connect shapes by clicking and dragging from one shape to another.
 - Use the "Clear Canvas" button to clear the canvas.
 - Use the "Save Canvas" button to save the current state to local storage. The saved state will persist even after refreshing the page.
